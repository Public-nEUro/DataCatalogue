{ "type": "dataset", "name": "A multimodal total-body dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT/MRI dataset of 100 healthy humans", "description": "We present a multimodal imaging dataset comprising dynamic total-body PET/CT/MRI acquisitions from 100 healthy adults stratified by age and sex. All participants underwent 70-minute dynamic 18F-FDG PET and low-dose CT on a Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra scanner, and MRI with whole-body and brain sequences on a Siemens MAGNETOM Vida scanner. The dataset includes listmode PET data, static and dynamic PET reconstructions, CT and MR images, and comprehensive organ and tissue segmentations generated by toolkits. All imaging data are organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure specification and includes image variants co-registered to three matrix spaces. Tables are also included with pre-extracted organ time-activity curves, static readouts, and Patlak Ki values for all segmented regions. This dataset can aid research in kinetic modeling, reconstruction methods, attenuation correction, image registration, multimodal learning, and the establishment of normative reference ranges for quantitative PET imaging across demographic groups.", "dataset_id": "PNC0002 A multimodal total-body 18F-FDG PET-CT-MRI dataset", "dataset_version": "V1", "keywords": [ "PET", "CT", "MRI", "LAFOV", "Whole-Body", "18F-FDG", "Control", "Dynamic", "Listmode", "Topogram" ], "license": { "name": "Data User Agreement" }, "metadata_sources": { "sources": [{"source_name": "NRU", "source_version": "1", "agent_name": "Cyril Pernet"}]}, "additional_display": [ { "name": "About", "content": { "Description": [ "Collection of three PET datasets using the 18F-FDG whole body imaging" ], "Keywords": [ "PET", "18F-FDG", "Whole-Body" ], "License": [ "Data User Agreement" ] } } ], "subdatasets": [ { "dataset_id": "PN000014 multimodal total-body 18F-FDG PET-CT-MRI - static images", "dataset_version": "V1", "dataset_path": "PN000014 hedy statics" }, { "dataset_id": "PN000015 multimodal total-body 18F-FDG PET-CT-MRI - dynamic images", "dataset_version": "V1", "dataset_path": "PN000015 multimodal total-body dynamic 18F-FDG PET-CT-MRI" }, { "dataset_id": "PN000016 multimodal total-body 18F-FDG PET-CT-MRI - source data", "dataset_version": "V1", "dataset_path": "PN000016 multimodal total-body source data 18F-FDG PET-CT-MRI" } ]}
