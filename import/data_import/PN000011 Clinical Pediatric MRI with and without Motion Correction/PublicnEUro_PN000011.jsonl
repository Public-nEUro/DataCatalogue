{"type": "dataset", "name": "A dataset of clinical pediatric brain MRI with and without motion correction", "description": "Our dataset consists of pediatric patients recruited from the Copenhagen Capital Region.  Participants eligible for inclusion were children aged 4 to 11 years, referred for an elective, scheduled clinical cerebral MRI scan under GA. Children were excluded if they presented with an unstable medical condition or any contraindications compromising the safety of MRI\u2014such as metal implants. Additional exclusion criteria included lack of fluency in Danish, significant visual or auditory impairments, or major physical or developmental challenges likely to interfere with participation in the experimental protocol. The number and type of images available for each patient vary but include a full cerebral clinical MRI protocol (see Supplementary Table \\ref{tab:protocols} for full description of the different MRI protocols). The data is structured according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format \\cite{Gorgolewski2016TheExperiments}, an open standard designed to facilitate MRI data sharing.
