Participants eligible for inclusion were children aged 4 to 11 years, referred for an elective, scheduled clinical cerebral MRI scan under GA. Children were excluded if they presented with an unstable medical condition or any contraindications compromising the safety of MRI\u2014such as metal implants. Additional exclusion criteria included lack of fluency in Danish, significant visual or auditory impairments, or major physical or developmental challenges likely to interfere with participation in the experimental protocol. The number and type of images available for each patient vary but include a full cerebral clinical MRI protocol (see Supplementary Table \\ref{tab:protocols} for full description of the different MRI protocols).

"Terms": "This Agreement records the terms under which the Transferring data controller gives a given Dataset (a defined set of data). This Agreement sets out the terms of the Data transfer between the Transferring data controller and receiving data controller. The transferring data controller has agreed to make the Data available on the terms and conditions set out in this DUA. The transfer of the Data is regulated in accordance with Danish legislation for the processing of personal health data and protection of individual human subject rights and privacy, including any relevant ethical and legal requirements.  By accepting this agreement, The receiving data controller becomes the data controller (as defined under the GDPR) of the dataset that will be transferred and is thus responsible for access and use following the terms of this agreement. 1. TRANSFER OF DATA. The transferring data controller's dataset is formatted following the brain imaging data structure (BIDS) - no other imaging data and metadata will be provided. 2. RIGHTS OF PROVIDER. Nothing in this Agreement prevents the transferring data controller from exploiting the Data or distributing the Data to any third party, including both profit and non-profit organizations. 3. USE OF THE DATA AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE  RECEIVING DATA CONTROLLER. 3.1 The receiving data controller: 3.1.1 must only use the Data for the purposes of medical and cognitive neuroscience  research. 3.1.2 must comply with all applicable laws and approval, including appropriate ethical juridical approvals and standards in relation to the use of the personal health Data and act as data controller in accordance to EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); 3.1.3 must treat the Data as confidential information and restrict access to the Data to those of its employee researchers who are directly involved in the Research and who are placed under an obligation to observe the terms of this DUA; 3.1.4 must take such reasonable steps to provide for the safe custody of any and all Data in its possession and to prevent unauthorized access thereto or use thereof; 3.1.5 under no circumstances attempt to re-identify the data subjects; will not link these data to any other database in a way that could provide identifying information. 3.1.6 must not transfer, sell, disseminate, disclose or otherwise distribute the Data to any third party 3.1.7 must not use the Data for any profit-making or commercial purposes without written approval from the transferring data controller; 3.1.8 must only share secondary or derivative data (e.g. group statistical maps or templates) if they are on a group level, and information from individual participants and cannot be deduced. 3.1.9 must not use the transferring data controller's name or logo without the prior written consent of such party; 3.1.10 accepts sole responsibility and liability for the conduct of the Research and will use the Data at its own risk and will obtain and maintain adequate insurance in respect of its use of the Data; 3.1.11 indemnifies the transferring data controller against all loss, liability, damage, (whether to persons or property), costs and expenses (including without limitation legal expenses), claims, demands, suits or other actions arising out of the receiving data controller's misuse of the Data; and 3.1.12 acknowledges and agrees that to the extent permitted by law, the transferring data controller excludes all warranties, express or implied, including without limitation warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular use, safety or quality in relation to the Transfer and use of the Data. The transferring data controller makes no representation and provides no warranty that the use of the Data will not infringe any Intellectual Property right of any other person. The Data is provided by the transferring data controller under this DUA on an 'as is' basis. 3.2 The receiving data controller must notify the transferring data controller promptly of all Results and will on the transferring data controller's request supply the transferring data controller with a report and/or outline of any Results, discoveries or comments in relation to the Research at the conclusion of the Research. 4.
