  "description": "Pediatric patients recruited from the Copenhagen Capital Region.  Participants eligible for inclusion were children aged 4 to 11 years, referred for an elective, scheduled clinical cerebral MRI scan under GA. Children were excluded if they presented with an unstable medical condition or any contraindications compromising the safety of MRI—such as metal implants. Additional exclusion criteria included lack of fluency in Danish, significant visual or auditory impairments, or major physical or developmental challenges likely to interfere with participation in the experimental protocol. The number and type of images available for each patient vary but include a full cerebral clinical MRI protocol. The primary advantage of this dataset is the publication of clinically acquired MRI data with and without motion correction. Together with the image data, motion curves, expert image quality scores by a radiographer as well as automatic image quality scores based on reference-free image quality metrics are shared (total size: 4.2GB)",

          "This Agreement records the terms under which the Transferring data controller gives a given Dataset (a defined set of data). This Agreement sets out the terms of the Data transfer between the Transferring data controller and receiving data controller. The transferring data controller has agreed to make the Data available on the terms and conditions set out in this DUA. The transfer of the Data is regulated in accordance with Danish legislation for the processing of personal health data and protection of individual human subject rights and privacy, including any relevant ethical and legal requirements.  By accepting this agreement, The receiving data controller becomes the data controller (as defined under the GDPR) of the dataset that will be transferred and is thus responsible for access and use following the terms of this agreement. 1. TRANSFER OF DATA. The transferring data controller's dataset is formatted following the brain imaging data structure (BIDS) - no other imaging data and metadata will be provided. 2.
